# Development Session Notes - 2025-10-30

This document captures the work completed in this development session, including challenges encountered and solutions implemented.

## Session Overview

**Goal:** Set up automated build and release workflow for x64dbg MCP plugins, fix MCP server issues, and test binary analysis functionality.

**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** Partially Complete - Core infrastructure ready, debugging Ghidra integration

---

## Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Fixed MCP Server API Incompatibility

**Problem:** Server crashed on startup with `AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'tool'`

**Root Cause:** Code was importing `mcp.server.Server` but using `@app.tool()` decorator from `fastmcp`

**Solution:**
- Changed imports from `mcp.server` to `fastmcp`
- Updated `Server` to `FastMCP` throughout codebase
- Simplified `main()` function to use FastMCP's built-in stdio handling
- Updated `dynamic_tools.py` imports and type hints

**Files Changed:**
- `src/server.py`
- `src/tools/dynamic_tools.py`

**Commit:** `1fe6978 - fix: Use FastMCP instead of Server for proper decorator support`

**Result:** ✅ Server now starts successfully and connects to Claude Desktop

---

### 2. Created Automated Plugin Build Workflow

**Goal:** Build x64dbg MCP plugins via GitHub Actions instead of requiring users to compile locally

**Implementation:**
- Created `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Workflow triggers on version tags (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- Builds both 64-bit and 32-bit plugins:
  - `x64dbg_mcp.dp64` (for x64dbg.exe - 64-bit binaries)
  - `x64dbg_mcp.dp32` (for x32dbg.exe - 32-bit binaries)
- Uses Windows runner with Visual Studio 2022
- Downloads x64dbg SDK automatically
- Creates GitHub release with pre-built binaries

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (new)
- `install.ps1` (enhanced plugin installation)
- `RELEASING.md` (new documentation)

**Commit:** `1227583 - feat: Add automated plugin build and release workflow`

**Benefits:**
- Users don't need Visual Studio Build Tools
- Professional distribution via GitHub releases
- Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit debugging
- Repeatable and automated

**Status:** ✅ Workflow ready, awaiting first release tag

---

### 3. Enhanced Windows PowerShell Installer

**Features Added:**
- Downloads pre-built x64dbg MCP plugins from GitHub releases
- Installs plugins to correct directories:
  - `x64dbg/release/x64/plugins/x64dbg_mcp.dp64`
  - `x64dbg/release/x32/plugins/x64dbg_mcp.dp32`
- Provides clear usage instructions for x64dbg vs x32dbg
- Handles missing releases gracefully

**Previous Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Unicode box-drawing characters causing parser errors → Replaced with ASCII
2. ✅ Java version check halting script → Wrapped in try-catch
3. ✅ Installer redundantly cloning when running from repo → Added detection logic

**Commit:** `1227583 - feat: Add automated plugin build and release workflow`

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional, ready for use

---

### 4. Made YARA Optional Dependency

**Problem:** `yara-python` requires Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools to compile on Windows

**Solution:**
- Moved `yara-python` to `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in `pyproject.toml`
- Core functionality works without YARA
- Users can optionally install with `uv sync --extra yara`

**Commit:** Previous session

**Result:** ✅ Installation works without Build Tools

---

### 5. Created Test Program

**Added:** `samples/test_program.c`
- Simple C program for testing binary analysis
- Contains strings, multiple functions, imports
- Designed to demonstrate analysis features

**Commit:** `6adb00d - feat: Add simple test program for binary analysis`

**Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully with Visual Studio

---

### 6. Documentation

**Created:**
- `RELEASING.md` - Complete release process guide
  - Version numbering (SemVer)
  - Creating releases with git tags
  - Workflow monitoring
  - Manual release fallback
  - Pre-release and hotfix procedures

**Commit:** `28de8ce - docs: Add release process documentation`

**Status:** ✅ Comprehensive release documentation

---

## Issues Encountered 🐛

### Issue 1: MCP Server Crash (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom:** `AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'tool'`

**Diagnosis:**
- Code mixing two different MCP libraries
- Using `mcp.server.Server` instead of `fastmcp.FastMCP`

**Fix:** Changed imports and updated server initialization

**Time to Fix:** ~15 minutes

---

### Issue 2: PowerShell Installer Unicode Issues (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom:** Parser errors with box-drawing characters (╔═╗║╚╝)

**Diagnosis:**
- UTF-8 encoding not compatible with PowerShell parser
- Windows console handling Unicode inconsistently

**Fix:** Replaced with ASCII characters (===)

**Time to Fix:** ~5 minutes

---

### Issue 3: PowerShell Script Halting on Java Check (FIXED ✅)

**Symptom:** Script stopped at `java -version` with red error text

**Diagnosis:**
- Java outputs version to stderr
- PowerShell's `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` treats stderr as fatal

**Fix:** Wrapped Java check in try-catch block

**Time to Fix:** ~10 minutes

---

### Issue 4: Ghidra Analysis Not Creating Output JSON (IN PROGRESS 🔄)

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Failed to analyze binary: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'C:\\Users\\localadmin\\.ghidra_mcp_cache\\temp_analysis_test_program.json'
```

**Diagnosis in Progress:**
- Ghidra runs successfully (takes ~40 seconds)
- Jython script (`core_analysis.py`) fails silently
- JSON output file never created
- No error visible in MCP logs

**Possible Causes:**
1. Environment variable `GHIDRA_CONTEXT_JSON` not passed to Jython
2. Path escaping issues (Windows backslashes)
3. Jython/Python version incompatibility
4. File write permissions
5. Script syntax error

**Debugging Steps Taken:**
1. ✅ Added logging to capture Ghidra stdout/stderr
2. ✅ Created debug log file: `C:\Users\localadmin\.ghidra_mcp_cache\ghidra_debug.log`
3. ✅ Added stderr prints visible in MCP logs
4. ⏳ Awaiting debug log output from user

**Commits:**
- `fc6b3cf - fix: Add detailed Ghidra output logging for debugging`
- `019d05e - fix: Add debug logging to file for Ghidra output`

**Next Steps:**
1. User pulls latest changes
2. User attempts analysis again
3. User provides `ghidra_debug.log` content
4. Diagnose exact Jython failure point
5. Fix script or environment variable passing

**Status:** 🔄 Actively debugging

- **Steps:** SDK download, x64 build, x32 build, release creation

---

## Known Limitations ⚠️

### 1. Ghidra Integration (Current Focus)
- Jython script not producing output
- Needs debugging with actual log output
- Blocking all static analysis features

### 2. x64dbg Integration
- Plugins not yet built (awaiting first release)
- C++ plugin requires manual build currently
- Documentation needs update once first release created

### 3. Platform Support
- x64dbg dynamic analysis: Windows only
- Ghidra static analysis: Cross-platform
- Installer: Separate scripts for Windows vs Linux/macOS

### 4. Cache Invalidation
- SHA256-based caching
- No automatic invalidation on binary changes
- Must manually delete cache or use `force_reanalyze=True`

## Lessons Learned 💡

### 1. Library Compatibility
**Issue:** Mixing `mcp.server` and `fastmcp` caused decorator errors

**Lesson:** Always verify which MCP library provides which features. FastMCP wraps base MCP with convenience features.

**Prevention:** Check imports and API documentation carefully

---

### 2. Windows Path Handling
**Issue:** Backslashes in Windows paths can cause issues in Python

**Lesson:** Use `Path` objects and proper escaping. Consider that environment variables may need special handling on Windows.

**Prevention:** Test on Windows early, use pathlib consistently

---

### 3. Silent Failures in Subprocesses
**Issue:** Ghidra runs but Jython script fails without visible errors

**Lesson:** Always capture and log subprocess output. Create debug files for complex integrations.

**Prevention:**
- Capture stdout/stderr
- Write debug logs
- Add explicit error checking
- Test subprocess commands manually first

---

### 4. PowerShell Unicode Handling
**Issue:** UTF-8 box-drawing characters broke PowerShell parser

**Lesson:** PowerShell on Windows has inconsistent Unicode support. Stick to ASCII for maximum compatibility.

**Prevention:** Use ASCII for critical system scripts

---

### 5. CI/CD for Binary Compilation
**Issue:** Users need C++ build tools to compile plugins

**Lesson:** Building in CI/CD removes user burden and ensures consistent builds

**Prevention:**
- Build all binary artifacts in CI
- Distribute via releases
- Document manual build as fallback only
